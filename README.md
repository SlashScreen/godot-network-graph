# Godot network utility

This is a WIP 3D network class for Godot 4. This is meant to be used for [Skelerealms](https://github.com/SlashScreen/skelerealms), but I'm putting it here just in case.
To install, install the [Submodule](https://github.com/SlashScreen/network_utility-submodule).

Documentation will come when it's done.
